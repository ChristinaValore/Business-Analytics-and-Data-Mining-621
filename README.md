# Business Analytics and Data Mining

This course teaches students to comb through complex business data sets to produce knowledge, and ultimately, business intelligence. 
Students learn the basics of business analytics. However, this course goes well beyond typical analytics for managers by including rich computational 
components for predictive and prescriptive analytics. Strategy and operational business contexts are provided via case studies throughout the course. 
Students will deal with actual business scenarios like sales, marketing, logistics, and finance. Students are expected to bring in practical problems 
from their own fields of interest. In addition, each student will be responsible for leading discussions in a particular application area. Teamwork is 
an essential part of the course.
